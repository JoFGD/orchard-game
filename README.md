# orchard-game

A project I did in my free time in collaboration with a 3D modeller and UI designer.

tree_data_loader - a script which unloads data from the player's database entry concerning tree position in their orchard. This happens after the player has 
chosen a plot from those available in the opening screen.

watering_can - a script which serves as the server-side part of a functioning watering can which can be used to water trees.

fruit_drop - a script which produces fruit from the trees in the player's plots. Each fruit starts as a flower and becomes a fully grown fruit.

emitter - a script which acts as a module which can be required and used by server scripts to create a new emitter.
